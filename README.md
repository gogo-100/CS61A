# CS61A

https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa22/

passed all tests✅︎, including optional parts (but can't guarantee the correctness of my code)

In this course, I have learned and practiced concepts such as higher-order functions, lambda expressions, yield, macros, tail calls, and more, thereby improving my Python skills. I have gradually become accustomed to using techniques like list comprehension, any/all, and others to enhance expressiveness. However, to be honest, I still have some questions regarding the concepts of macros, non-local, and functions as data. I hope to gain a deeper understanding of these concepts in my future learning journey.

Furthermore, the projects in this course, including the Scheme interpreter and various games such as dice games, card games, and a simplified version of Plants vs. Zombies.From them I've learned a lot, opened black-box that were once mysterious, I've dispelled some of the fears from ignorance.

In conclusion, I must express my gratitude to the CS61A team for their hard work. This course has a remarkably high level of completion, as an introductory course, I feel that this is a class that instills a sense of awe for computer knowledge meamwhile sparking your interest. Rather than refine my knowledge base, I would like to say that this course has shown me what excellent CS education looks like. I can't imagine how joyful it would be to learn in such a classroom!
